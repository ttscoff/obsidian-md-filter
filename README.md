# Obsidian Markdown Filter

## Introduction

Takes an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) Markdown file and processes it for viewing in [Marked 2](https://marked2app.com). Set this script as a custom preprocessor in Marked 2 to make it work:

## Overview

What does the filter do? The main idea is that the output of the filter is a document that can live on its own, outside of an Obsidian vault. To achieve that, it: 

- Replaces internal Obsidian links with just the text of the link.
    - `[[Link to other page|Alias]]` becomes `Alias`
    - `[[Link to other page]]` becomes `Link to other page`
    - `[[Link to other page#Reference]]` becomes `Link to other page > Reference`
- Replaces transclusions with IA Writer block syntax
    - `![[File to include]]` becomes `/path/to/File to include.extension`
- Strips all block IDs from the content
    - `Text ending with ^block-id` becomes `Text ending with`
- Strips all Emoji's from the content, if enabled (see Settings below)
    - `üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Foo bar` becomes `Foo bar`
    
In case the document being previewed is not in an Obsidian vault, this processor does nothing.

## Transclusions

- A transclusion only works if the instruction is on a single line, all by itself. Obsidian is more flexible, but Marked 2 is not. I don't want to rewrite the source content too much.
- Transclusions don't work if the referenced file doesn't exist or has multiple matches in the Obsidian vault.
- Transcluded files are not processed themselves. So, nested transclusion don't work. According to the Marked 2 documentation it should work, but that's not my experience. I haven't looked into it further.
- I chose to use the IA Writer block syntax for three reasons:
    1. It has the cleanest syntax in my opinion.
    2. It works for many different file types.
    3. I use iA Writer myself, next to Obsidian, so I'm familiar with it.

## Obsidian vaults

This filter looks for the vault the file being processed is in by locating the `.obsidian` directory in the directory structure, going upward from the current file. If this directory can't be found, the file being processed is considered not to be in a vault, in which case the filter does nothing.

## Resolving internal links

The way the filter resolves references in `[[internal links]]` is by globbing for `**/internal links*`, starting from the root of the vault. This is **not** the same as what Obsidian does, but it works perfectly for me, because every one of my files has a name that is unique across the entire vault, allowing me to move files around within the vault without breaking anything.

Your mileage may vary though.

## Settings

The filter can be configured per-vault by putting a file `.obsidian-md-filter` in the root of the vault. This must be a YAML file. Currently it supports just one setting:

```yaml
strip_emojis: true
```
